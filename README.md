Zombies vs Humans as a Genetic Algorithm

This code demonstrates Zombies vs Humans as a GA in which the Humans can breed and develop better survival abilities.

The zombies don't evolve...they are zombies, it made sense that way in a Lamarkian vs. Traditional evolution way.

Some key libs and bits of code have been ommitted as I don't want the full code taken.
